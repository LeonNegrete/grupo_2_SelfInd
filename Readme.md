> Self ind proposal is to let your clothing business take an extra step into creativity, being not only a complete eCommerce, with MySQL database, and admin dashboard running on React.js but also adding the 'Make it yours' functionality, which allows the user to take the design into their own hands, making it unique and truly their own, being able also to share it with other users, once an admin approves it in the dashboard. The canvas allows the upload of an image and the basic functionalities of paint, in addition to this it has built-in some extra brush tools that are really fun to use

## About Us
We are a team of 3 developers located in latin america, students and workers with the ambition of self-improvement through collective cooperation, *and fundamentally united by the code*

## Inspiration Sites

To get a better direction and some ideas we take inspiration from many websites. This is are the ones we like

* [FlashCookie](https://flashcookie.com)

It is the first merchandising platform for independent artists in Argentina. This business is in charge of the production and logistics of the garments, its platform allows the artist to upload a design, accommodate it virtually on the garment and once confirmed they take care of the printing and shipping.
* [Nike](https://nike.com) 

The renowned brand Nike exempts presentation, was particularly a source of inspiration since recently on its USA page they began to offer users the possibility of customizing shoes by choosing designs and colors in an interesting 3D interface.
* [Enlighted](https://www.enlighted.com.ar/)

Enlighted presents us with a bold and different web design, we are not aiming for a similar design since it does not offer the most user friendly interface of all, but we still see it as an element of inspiration in the creative framework of SelfInd design.
* [Better With Age](https://betterwithage.co/)

During the development of the html and css, we looked for more pages to better guide the design, better with age had an identical design to the one we are developing, so it gives us a good guide that we are going down one of the many correct paths .
* [Unfinished Legacy](https://unfinishedlegacy.co/)

Like better with age, Unfinished Legacy shows us the classic layout with a nav bar where the logo is centered and we find the cart on the far right and the burger menu on the left. Below this we find a carousel and below it the catalog.
